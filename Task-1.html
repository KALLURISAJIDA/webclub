            The Taj Mahal ('Crown of the Palace') is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra ,Uttar Pradesh, India. It was 
        
    commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb 
    
    of Shah Jahan himself.The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare(42-acre) complex,which includes a mosque and a guest house,and is set in formal gardens 
    
    bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the 
    
    project for another 10 years.The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 
    
    ₹32 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion. The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of 
    
    architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect.Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and 
    
    divinity.The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired 
    
    masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal 
    
    attracts 7-8 million visitors a year, and<b> in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</b>

    <pre>
        The Great Wall of China ( literally "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of 
        
ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe.Several walls were built from as early as the 7th

century BC,with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC),the first emperor of China.Little of the Qin wall remains.Later on,many successive 

dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) . Apart from 

defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls,allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or 

encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.Furthermore,the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction 

of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also 

served as a transportation corridor. The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the east 

to Lop Lake in the west,from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of 

the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most 

impressive architectural feats in history.<b>And it was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.</b>

            The Colosseum ( Italian: Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo]) is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum.
            
    It he largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the 
    
    emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further modifications were made during the 
    
    reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian 
    
    Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name 
    
    (Flavius).The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone,tuff (volcanic rock),and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators 
    
    at various points in its history, having an average audience of some 65,000;it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, 
    
    executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles.The building ceased to be used for entertainment 
    
    in the early medieval era .<b>Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is still a renowned symbol of Imperial 
    
    Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.</b>

        Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.Often referred 

to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province above the 

Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a 

tropical mountain climate.The Inca civilization had no written language and, after the discovery by a Spanish soldier Baltasar Ocampo, by the end of the 16th-

century no more Europeans visited the site until the 19th century, so far as is known, so there are no written records of the site while it was in use. The names 

of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants are the product of modern archaeologists based on physical evidence, including tombs at the site. 

Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style,with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana,the Temple of the Sun, and the 

Temple of the Three Windows. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give visitors a better idea of how they originally appeared. By 

1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues. Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the 

Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472).<b>Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1982 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.In 2007,Machu Picchu

was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet poll.</b>

<pre>
        Petra ("Rock"), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the 

    mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.
    
    The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom 
    
    as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time 
    
    Petra had become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major 
    
    regional trading hub.Access to the city is through a 1.2-kilometre-long (3⁄4 mi) gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh. Famous for its 
    
    rock-cut architecture and water conduit system,<b>Petra is also called the "Rose City"</b> because of the colour of the stone from which it is carved. It has been 
    
    a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985.<b>UNESCO has described Petra as "one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage". In 2007,Petra 
    
    was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World</b>.Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers peaked at 
    
    1.1 million in 2019, marking the first time that the figure rose above the 1 million mark.

    Christ The Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski 
    
and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. 

Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide. It is 

made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. Christ The Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe 

in one hand and a cross in the other.Although the project organisers originally accepted the design,it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread 

out wide. The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca 

National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. <b>A symbol of Christianity around the world,the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro 

and Brazil and was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.</b>

         Yucatán officially the Free and Sovereign State of Yucatán,[c] is one of the 31 states which comprise the federal entities of Mexico. It comprises 106 
         
    separate municipalities, and its capital city is Mérida. It is located on the northern part of the Yucatán Peninsula. It is bordered by the states of Campeche 
    
    to the southwest and Quintana Roo to the southeast, with the Gulf of Mexico off its northern coast. Before the arrival of Spaniards in the Yucatán Peninsula, 
    
    the name of this region was Mayab. In the Yucatec Maya language, mayab means "flat", and is the source of the word "Maya" itself. The peninsula was a very 
    
    important region for the Maya civilization, which reached the peak of its development here, where the Mayans founded the cities of Chichen Itza, Izamal, Motul, 
    
    Mayapan, now Mérida. After the Spanish conquest of Yucatán (early 16th to late 17th centuries), the Yucatán peninsula became a single administrative and 
    
    political entity, the Captaincy General of Yucatán. Following Mexican independence in 1821 the local Governor proclaimed independence. Yucatán became part of 
    
    the Mexican Empire in December 1821. After the collapse of the first Mexican Empire in March 1823, the first Republic of Yucatán (founded in May 1823) 
    
    voluntarily negotiated annexation to the Federal Republic of United Mexican States on December 21, 1823.<b>As of 2016 the Mexican National Public Security System 
        
    ranked Yucatán as "one of the safest states in Mexico". Mérida was awarded City of Peace in 2011.And it is the one of the new Seven Wondersof the World.</b>
